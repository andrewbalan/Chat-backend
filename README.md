# Chat (backend)
This is the backend of my chat application, which one allows
users to exchange the messages. This app was developed
with express.js/mongoose.js/socket-io.

During the process of developing of this app it were resolved
such tasks as:
* token based authorization/authentication
* work with deep nested mongodb data
* work with socket-io separate rooms
* file streaming through socket-io
